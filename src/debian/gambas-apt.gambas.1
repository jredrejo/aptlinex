.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B gambas\-apt.gambas [\fIuser\fR] package 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.B gambas\-apt.gambas
 command

.PP 

\fBgambas\-apt.gambas\fP is a program installed by the aptlinex Debian package.
Executing it from a command line does not have too much sense, only for debugging
purposes.

The program will install the 
.B package
using standard apt utils.
The installation will be done according to the sources.list the user has already setup. gambas\-apt will not modify that setup.
If the package has a freedesktop.org menu or a Debian menu, after installing it will show a dialog offering to create a Desktop launcher.

.PP 
The logical use of this program is being launched from a web browser, answering to a link using the apt:// protocol.

.SH "OPTIONS"
These program only have a possible option:
.TP 
\fIuser\fR
user name that launches gambas\-apt. If ommited it will be 'root'
